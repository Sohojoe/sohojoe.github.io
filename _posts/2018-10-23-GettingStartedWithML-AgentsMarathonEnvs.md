* 002.135 - backflip (StyleTransfer002) with random trainer = 32m - so so, better than 133 but not as good as 134; will keep training both
* 002.134 - backflip (StyleTransfer002) start frame 1 = 32m - **is working best so far**

… abort if distanceReward < 0.334f (was 0.18f)

----
* 002.133 - backflip (StyleTransfer002) with random trainer = aborts out of backflip, try more aggressive distanceReward abort
* 002.132 - runningv2 (StyleTransfer002) with random trainer  = trains well after 32m sim steps, train for more

… revert early terminate during training after 50 steps
… reset if reward < 0.18 or torso, head, bum hit ground

----
* 002.130 = backflip (StyleTransfer002) with random trainer = not great, seams really wobbly, not sure the 50 steps thing is working out so well

… StyleTransfer002TrainerAgent ignores skipped frames (so backflip goes from 430 to 83 frames)
… time_horizon: 50 (was 1000)
… turn jointAtLimitPenality into jointsNotAtLimitReward 

----
* 002.129 = backflip (StyleTransfer002e) normal batch size = hard to tell
* 002.128 = backflip (StyleTransfer002f) 1/4 batch size = doesn’t do well

… 64 agents

----
* 002.127 = backflip (StyleTransfer002e) with random trainer = 
* 002.126 = backflip (StyleTransfer002f) = not sure

… early terminate during training after 50 steps

----
* 002.125 = backflip (StyleTransfer002e) = not sure

… reset if reward < 0.18

----
* 002.124 = backflip (StyleTransfer002f) )
* … trainerAgent does not reset on done = Same, takes easy way out of backflip
* 002.122 = backflip (StyleTransfer002e) ) = OK, but takes easy way out of backflip so that he stands for longer

… rework reward so never negative 

----
* 002.121 = backflip (StyleTransfer002e) (minor tweak) = is learning to fail as this is higher reward than negatives
* 002.120 = backflip (StyleTransfer002e) = NOT WORKING 

… TrainerBrain - Adversarial network to choose where to focus training

----
* 002.119 = jazzDance (StyleTransfer002d) = 
* 002.118 = MMAKick (StyleTransfer002b) = 
* 002.117 = backflip (StyleTransfer002a) = 

… remove clip on reward

----
* 002.116 = backflip (StyleTransfer002d) -1 on fail (was -100) = gets to 161 (uses hand to end back spin (I guess to reduce error?)
* 002.115 = backflip (StyleTransfer002c) = gets to 152 even with 352m physics steps / 70m training steps
* 002.114 = runningv2 (StyleTransfer002b) = 
* 002.113 = walking (StyleTransfer002) = 

… fix AnimationBase and MarathonMan referenced shin in Agent2

----
* 002.112 = backflip (StyleTransfer002c) = 
* 002.111 = runningv2 (StyleTransfer002b) = 
* 002.110 = walking (StyleTransfer002) = training better, but strange problem with Agent02

… fixed Muscle002 apply force to use max of XY (was average which did not work so well when one was 0)

----
* 002.109 = backflip (StyleTransfer002c) = ok but not as good as 106, something is not right
* 002.108 = runningv2 (StyleTransfer002b) = ok but not as good as 105, something is not right
* 002.107 = walking (StyleTransfer002) = ok but not as good as 104, something is not right

… make all non-arm joints use one joint

----
* 002.106 = backflip (StyleTransfer002c) = statistically improves but still not training
* 002.105 = runningv2 (StyleTransfer002b) = trains well, best ever
* 002.104 = walking (StyleTransfer002) = trains really well

… make feet use one joint (2 axis)

----
* 002.103 = walking (StyleTransfer002) =

… tweak foot rotations and power

----

* 002.101 = walking (StyleTransfer002d) =

… tweaked humanoid

----
* 002.100 = backflip (StyleTransfer002c) = 1m signs of training but a long way to go
* 002.099 = running (StyleTransfer002b) = **2m trains a little, needs random inference, bad feet choices**
* 002.098 = walking (StyleTransfer002) = **2m trains well after - but feet are still floppy**

… fix - reduce bounce on spawn

----

… fix - velocaties / rotationVelocity where bleeding past reset

----

* 002.090 = running (StyleTransfer002b) -300 penalty, time_horizon: 128 (was 1000)
* 002.089 = running (StyleTransfer002b) -300 penalty = 
* 002.088 = running (StyleTransfer002b) = 1m: seams about the same
* 002.087 = walking (StyleTransfer002) = 1m: seams about the same

… add  sensorReward comparing differences in sensor states
… now 3 sensors per feet

----
* 002.086 = walking (StyleTransfer002d) = 100 early exit, no done reward, train for 5m / 80m steps = doesn’t train well
* 002.085 = running (StyleTransfer002) = 100 early exit, no done reward, train for 5m / 80m steps = trains ok, feel are still a problem. Not sure any improvement over previous attemtps
